## 📁 Projects Included

This repository contains three integrated modules, each addressing a critical stage of the machine learning research and experimentation pipeline:

### 1. End-to-End Machine Learning Framework (`end_to_end_ml_framework.py`)  
A complete pipeline for feature engineering, model training, selection, and evaluation.  
- Automates data preprocessing and model comparison across multiple algorithms.  
- Integrates Bayesian optimization to improve predictive performance (~15% gain).  
- Saves experiment artifacts and metrics for reproducibility and future benchmarking.

### 2. Bayesian Optimization for Model Selection (`bayes_opt_model_selection.py`)  
A standalone Gaussian process–based optimization engine for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Reduces model training time by ~25% and improves generalization by ~12%.  
- Enables scalable experimentation and automated search across large parameter spaces.  
- Ideal for research scenarios requiring repeated optimization and performance tracking.

### 3. Model Analysis and Visualization Toolkit (`model_analysis_toolkit.py`)  
A diagnostic and interpretability module to analyze model behavior and performance.  
- Evaluates key metrics, feature importance, and permutation impacts.  
- Generates JSON analysis reports and visual summaries for research documentation.  
- Supports iterative model refinement and collaboration between data scientists and domain experts.
